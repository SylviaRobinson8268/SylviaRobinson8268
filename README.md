## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm an embedded systems developer specializing in C++ and ARM-based microcontrollers to design efficient, reliable, and high-performance embedded applications. This repository features a collection of projects and code samples focused on real-time system design, low-level programming, and performance optimization for resource-constrained environments.

Working close to the hardware demands a deep understanding of system architecture, memory management, and timing precision. My projects aim to demonstrate how to build responsive and deterministic embedded systemsâ€”from bare-metal applications to real-time operating systems (RTOS)-based designs.

Real-Time Systems: Many examples here involve the use of real-time scheduling, task prioritization, and interrupt-driven workflows. You'll find code using FreeRTOS, CMSIS-RTOS, and custom task schedulers to meet strict timing constraints in safety-critical and time-sensitive applications.

Low-Level Programming: These projects showcase direct register manipulation, peripheral configuration, and startup code tailored for ARM Cortex-M processors. You'll also find linker script customizations, memory-mapped I/O handling, and bootloader development.

Performance Optimization: Efficient use of CPU cycles, RAM, and power is a central theme. I use techniques like DMA (Direct Memory Access), loop unrolling, fixed-point arithmetic, and compile-time configuration to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

This repository is designed for embedded engineers, firmware developers, and anyone interested in pushing the limits of microcontroller performance. Each project includes detailed documentation, hardware references, and build instructions using tools like GCC, CMake, and platform-specific SDKs.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”whether you're working on robotics, IoT, or industrial control systems, I hope these examples support your development efforts.
